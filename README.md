# Federated-Unlearning-Exploring-Machine-Unlearning-in-a-Distributed-Environment
Client-level machine unlearning in federated learning using Diffusive Noise Injection (DNI). Our method removes target data contributions while preserving global model accuracy, evaluated on CNNs, ViTs, and benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, KVASIR).
